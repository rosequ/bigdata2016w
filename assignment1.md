####Question 5.
(maine, anjou)	3.6331422

(anjou, maine)	3.6331422

(milford, haven)	3.6201773

(haven, milford)	3.6201773

(cleopatra's, alexandria)	3.5387795

(rosencrantz, guildenstern)	3.5383153

(guildenstern, rosencrantz)	3.5383153

(personae, dramatis)	3.5316846

(dramatis, personae)	3.5316846

#####Why such high PMI:

There are special terms, names, etc. such as "Duke of Anjou and Maine", "Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S" and "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern" in Shakespeare. Therefore these terms often appears together. P(x,y)≈P(x)≈P(y)

These terms are also not that common pairs such as "a the". N(x,y), N(x), N(y) are all small in absolute count, which makes its N(x,y)/[N(x)*N(y)] value is relatively large.
